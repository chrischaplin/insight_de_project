There are comments throughout the code explaining what is going on.

In general...
(1) Driver code is Generate_Anomaly_List.py
(2) Parsing functions and compute functions are in functions.py
(3) Node class is in classes.py
(4) Graph class is borrowed from networkx python package

I have yet to test editing the graph (connections) from the stream input, but the purchase finder works

A lot of this was brute force due to time constraints.
But thanks for the opporunity!
